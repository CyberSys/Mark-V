# Mark V

An unreleased Sega Genesis emulator app I wrote for Blackberry 10 devices a few years ago. It used [Genesis Plus GX](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX) for the emulation backend. A port for QNX can be found in [a gist](https://gist.github.com/steven741/1eba2a3e2d3c0667c4c081f0182fcc3b).

# Features

* Well integrated into the BB10 ecosystem
* Pulls game box art from the internet to use as iconography
* Takes screenshots randomly which will be displayed in thumbnail mode
